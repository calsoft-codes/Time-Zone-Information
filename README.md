# World Time Zones Information Project in Python

## Overview

This Python project retrieves and displays information about world time zones using the parser, json, and request modules. The goal is to create a production-ready application for critical environments, incorporating various Python features such as classes, argparse, and decorators.

## Project Requirements

- Write production-ready code for critical environments.
- Utilize Python features such as classes, argparse, and decorators.
- Download time zone information in JSON format from [timezones.json](https://github.com/dmfilipenko/timezones.json/blob/master/timezones.json).

## Technical Approach

The project emphasizes the use of Python processes like classes, argparse module, and decorators. The default behavior is to parse information from the provided JSON and display time zones in a user-friendly tabular format.

## Code Implementation

The implementation includes the default behavior and optional arguments using argparse:
- Default: Parse information from JSON and display time zones in a user-friendly tabular format.
- Optional arguments:
  - `--match`: Display information about time zones matching the provided string.
  - `--offset`: Display time zones matching the specified offset, considering time zones ahead of and behind UTC.

## Unit Testing

Unit tests are included to ensure the reliability of the code. Examples cover different scenarios to validate the functionality of the program.

## Sharing Code

To share your code and collaborate:
- Upload it to a version control system like GitHub.
